# SVG Fonts

SVG fonts suitable for use with [Hershey Text v3](https://gitlab.com/oskay/hershey-text) and later

A curated subset of the fonts in this repository are included with the Hershey Text distribution.


#### Font license information

Individual credits and license information are embedded within the SVG fonts in this repository.

The classic Hershey fonts included are derived from
work by Dr. A. V. Hershey.

Additional modern "EMS" fonts in this distribution are
derivatives created from fonts licensed under the SIL
Open Font License.

A linked summary of those fonts can be found at https://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Hershey_Text

#### Contributing

Contributions to this collection are welcome. Contributions may be made through an [issue](https://gitlab.com/oskay/svg-fonts/issues) or properly formatted merge request to this repository.
You can also contact us through the Evil Mad Scientist [contact form](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/contact).

Please keep in mind the following guidelines:
*  Fonts should be in the [SVG 1.1 font format](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/fonts.html) and tested to work well with Hershey Text.
*  Matched pairs consisting of an SVG font plus a matching TTF or OTF font are welcome. 
Font pairs like this should be tested to work well for automatic substitution in Hershey Text.
*  Fonts should be licensed in such a way that they are compatible with open source distribution.
Where possible, we recommend to use the [SIL Open Font LIcense](https://scripts.sil.org/OFL) or a public
domain declaration. In cases of license ambiguity, please ask.
*  Font credit and license information should ideally be embedded within the font file metadata.
*  Font credit and license information may also be included in separate readme file.
